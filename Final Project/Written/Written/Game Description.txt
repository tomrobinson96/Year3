For my dissertation I created a game which aids the learning of C# for people brand new to programming. This game has a randomly spawning map and boxes that will contain a task for the user to walk through, when the task is complete the player can then get a new weapon to attack enimies with. The random spawning will help the player retain attention when restarting as they will not be able to go to the same spot for the same question.
