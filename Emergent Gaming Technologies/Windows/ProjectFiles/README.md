Leap First Person Look
=========

Quick and dirty Unity demo showing how you can use the Leap as a mouse replacement for looking around in a traditional first person control scheme.

There is a jumping puzzle that's there to use a skill test to compare the difference between using a mouse and using Leap. Mouse input also works so you can try both for a comparison.

You can also pull cubes towards the camera by closing your fist. This is to demonstrate that the same hand used for camera look can do other gestures as well.
